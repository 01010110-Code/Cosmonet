# Cosmonet
Cosmonet is a Metaverse portal designed to provide a captivating and immersive experience for space enthusiasts. This repository contains the front-end codebase for Cosmonet, built using Next.js, Framer Motion, and Tailwind CSS.

## Technologies Used:

Next.js: Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). It allows for efficient and optimized rendering of web pages, providing a fast and seamless user experience. Next.js also provides features like automatic code splitting, routing, and serverless functions, making it an excellent choice for building scalable web applications.

Framer Motion: Framer Motion is a powerful animation library for React that simplifies the process of creating smooth and visually appealing animations. With Framer Motion, you can easily animate components, create transitions, and add interactive gestures to enhance the user experience. It provides a declarative syntax and a wide range of animation options, allowing you to bring your designs to life effortlessly.

Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that offers a highly customizable and responsive styling solution. It provides a set of pre-defined utility classes that can be easily combined to build complex layouts and styles. Tailwind CSS promotes a "design-system" approach, where you can create and reuse design components efficiently. Its utility-based approach reduces the need for writing custom CSS, resulting in faster development cycles.
